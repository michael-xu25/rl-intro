# Git Workflow

After making code changes:

1. **Always commit and push** when you're done with a set of changes. Do not wait for the user to ask.
2. Write clear commit messages explaining *why*, not just *what*.
3. If `git push` fails due to remote changes, do `git pull --rebase origin main` first, resolve conflicts, then push.
4. Delete the `data/entity_tracking_dataset` directory reminder: if reward functions or `build_entity_dataset.py` change, remind the user to delete and rebuild the dataset on Lightning.
