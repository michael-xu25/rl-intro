# Remote GPU Commands

When giving the user a command to run on a remote machine (Lightning, SSH, etc.):

1. **Always wrap in `nohup` with logging** so it survives laptop close / SSH disconnect:
   ```bash
   nohup python src/some_script.py --flags > logs/some_script_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log 2>&1 &
   ```
2. **Include `tail -f`** so they can watch progress:
   ```bash
   tail -f logs/some_script_*.log
   ```
3. **Create the logs directory** if it might not exist: `mkdir -p logs`
4. Never give a bare `python src/...` command for anything that takes more than a minute.
