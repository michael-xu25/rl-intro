# Tiny-Math-Solver — Pinned Dependencies
# Install with: pip install -r requirements.txt
# Or run: bash setup.sh (handles everything including dataset build)
#
# IMPORTANT: Do NOT install openrlhf — it forces flash-attn==2.8.3
# which conflicts with everything.

# Core training stack
trl>=0.18.0
transformers>=4.51.0
peft>=0.14.0
accelerate>=1.2.0
datasets>=3.0.0

# Logging
wandb

# Pin numpy: must be <2.3 for numba (vLLM dep), and works with matplotlib
numpy>=1.26,<2.3

# NOTE: We do NOT pin torch — use whatever the environment provides.
# NOTE: We do NOT install vllm — colocate mode + PEFT has known bugs.
#       If you want vLLM server mode in the future, install separately:
#       pip install vllm==0.12.0
